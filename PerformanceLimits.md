# Simulation time #

Simulation time depends on the following:
  * Number of micro-units
  * Number of runs performed
  * Number of iterations per run
  * Number and type of transitions
  * Number and type of run results required

Typically the most time-intensive part of the simulation is the collation of results across multiple runs.

Simario is currently being used on small populations of 1,000 micro-units and is performing single runs is a couple of seconds. More intensive performance testing is still to be completed.
